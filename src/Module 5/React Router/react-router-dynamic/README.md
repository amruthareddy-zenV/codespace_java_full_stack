This project demonstrates how to set up **React Router**, create static and dynamic routes, and navigate between components using **React Hooks** and **react-router-dom**.

---

## ✅ Features

- React Router v6 setup
- Static and dynamic routes
- Navigation using `useNavigate`
- Route parameters using `useParams`
- Page Not Found (404) handling

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- ReactJS (with Hooks)
- react-router-dom (v6)
- Functional Components
- Dynamic Route Handling

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

```
react-router-dynamic/
├── components/
│   ├── Navbar.js
│   ├── Home.js
│   ├── About.js
│   ├── UserProfile.js
│   └── NotFound.js
└── README.md
```

---

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install react-router-dom
```

---

## 🧭 Basic Setup: `src/App.jsx`

## 📂 Navbar Component: `components/Navbar.jsx`

## 🏠 Home Component: `components/Home.jsx`

## ℹ️ About Component: `components/About.jsx`

## 👤 Dynamic Route Component: `components/UserProfile.jsx`

## 🚫 404 Not Found: `components/NotFound.jsx`

---

## 🚀 Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔄 Test Dynamic Routes

- Visit `/user/john_doe`
- Visit `/user/anyname`
- Navigate with `useNavigate` from Navbar

---

## 📚 Key Concepts

- `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route`
- `useParams()` – Extract dynamic route values
- `useNavigate()` – Navigate programmatically
- `*` route for 404 Not Found
