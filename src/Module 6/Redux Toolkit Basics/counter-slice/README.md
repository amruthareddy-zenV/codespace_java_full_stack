# 🔢 Counter Slice (Basic)

A beginner-level project demonstrating the **basics of Redux Toolkit** in a React application. This project shows how to set up Redux Toolkit, create slices, and manage state for a simple counter.

---

## ✅ Project Goals

- Setup Redux Toolkit in a React app
- Create a `counterSlice` to manage state
- Use `useDispatch` and `useSelector` hooks
- Implement basic increment/decrement functionality

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- ReactJS
- Redux Toolkit
- React Redux

## 📦 Installation

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

---

## 🔧 Configure Store: `counter-slice/src/app/store.jsx`

## 🧩 Counter Slice: `counter-slice/src/features/counter/counterSlice.jsx`

## 🖼 Counter UI Component: `counter-slice/src/features/counter/Counter.jsx`

## 🔌 Integrate Redux with React: `src/main.jsx`

## 📄 Use Component in App: `src/App.jsx`

---

## 🚀 Run the Project

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## 🧠 Concepts Covered

- `configureStore()` for setting up Redux Toolkit
- Creating slices using `createSlice()`
- Connecting Redux store to React with `Provider`
- Managing state using `useSelector()` and `useDispatch()`
